The purpose of the assignment was to recreate the front-end design of a website. The website is for [Barcamp Omaha 2014][barcamp]. We had several assets to layer to create the design correctly.

An additional component to incorporate into the assignment was to begin with a mobile first design and make it responsive across larger screen sizes. This was accomplished using a media query in the css file.
