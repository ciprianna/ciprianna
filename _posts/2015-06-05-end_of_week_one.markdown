It's the end of Week 1!  I made it an entire week! It's been turbulent, but I feel so much smarter on Classes and Class interactions now. All the prep work we've done has been extremely helpful, too. It was no joke in the class description that the prep work is intended to get us to a decent working level, because we didn't really cover that material. It's been expected that we came in knowing it, and moved on from there.  That's definitely been true, and now I feel much better about Classes and Objects this week than I did before.

I finished my DinnerClub project, and created three (whoa, *three* whole Classes!) to do it. I was able to display all of a Dinner Club's history, all of it's members and their associated running tabs. Pretty exciting!

Today's project, and homework for the weekend, is to create a rock, paper, scissors game using Classes. This starts very basic and becomes increasingly more complicated as we build onto it.

I have to work all weekend, so unfortunately I won't have much time to devote to it. That makes me feel a bit of anxiety, because I feel like this project will definitely require some dedicated time as it becomes more complicated, but I'll do what I can. Today at least, I was able to get it to a decent working level that includes a few complexities, so that's good. Some crazy complexities include adding in a computer player or adding the ability to play rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock. It seems pretty difficult, but hopefully I can work through it.

Reflections on the week in general: I've learned that I have to be humble and know when to give up. I'm new to this. *So, very, new*. I really don't know much yet, but I have faith that I will learn. I have also gotten better this week about admitting when I can't solve a problem. I know I'm not the only one that struggles. I've had multiple times this week where I've had to ask a question from someone else in class who has figured out how to do something. It feels almost like I'm cheating by getting someone else's solutions.  However, back to point one, I'm really new at this, and meanwhile things like StackOverflow are fantastic :)
