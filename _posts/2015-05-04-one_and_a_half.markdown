So, I'm feeling a bit stressed!!!  Looking at the amount of work I've done/have to do, it's still a bit intimidating.  I'm working full time right now, and I had to work over the weekend - no days off!  It would have been ideal to take some good, focused time this weekend to work on studying and go through the practice problems, but that wasn't happening with my work schedule.  So...I've had to work for a few hours each night and try to understand as much as I can to get through all the material.

But, I'm motivated, too.  I'm already proud of the progress I've made in learning how to code in Ruby so far! I feel infinitely better than I was a week and a half ago.  I read, and try, and read, and try, and Google, and try, and maybe it works!  Sometimes, it works on the first shot!  Either way, it's like an interesting game of logic to see if I'm thinking of all the things I need to communicate to Ruby to write the correct program and then seeing if the program interprets it all correctly.  It's like a fun puzzle.

The problems are getting progressively more difficult, however, so hopefully it stays more fun than stressful from here.  I've just got to get through the hump of working full-time, then working through the study materials and practice problems at night (oh, and moving sometime in the next few weeks, too!).  I'm excited to be in school full-time and really focus on learning as much as I can every day.
