Finally finished with the Shoes Inventory Management System (for now, of course!). That's been a fairly complex project to think through and keep track of. Our next project is similar. We're implementing a new project using Sinatra. Requirements include creating at least one many-to-many relationship, ever flexing our brains to go further.

I've chosen to create a program that allows users to select food they have available from a food database and receive a list of recipes they are able to make in return, categorized by food-type.  I figured I'd be struggling for a topic forever, but my creativity (or un-creativity? this isn't *super* fun) kicked in.

So, from the idea, we were tasked to conceptualize the specs of the project. What should it do? What shouldn't it do? Does it meet requirements? This took a great deal of thought because I've never really thought through a programming project from top to bottom. Some people were lightning fast with this; others took more time. I was probably somewhere in the middle. I think it helps me to try to think through as many things as possible up front. Once I completed that, we created issues that would be used to actually track specific tasks linked to milestones. This seems like a super-cool way to be organized! I love that aspect. I'm the kind of person that enjoys walking through the "office supply" sections of stores for this reason (is that really a *kind* of person, or is it just me? :S ). This should be a great way to keep track of everything, which is one of the problems I had with the inventory project in Sinatra!

After that, I moved on to created a diagram of the models and tables needed to run this program. Specifying out the relationships between our models really helps me to think about what I want the program to *do*. This helped give me some clarity to where to start in the actual coding process. Well, that and the handy dandy issues/milestones.

Today was really just about where to start a project and how to get organized. That's a useful perspective for me and one I've been struggling with a bit.
