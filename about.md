Hi, I'm Ciprianna! I'm new to programming and am blogging my experiences in coding!


![Hi, everyone!](/thumb_DC_pic_1024.jpg) My background is in data analysis, and I have a master's degree in International Studies, with an emphasis on research design and analysis.

With data analysis, I grew an interest in programming by using R and struggling mightily to learn Python.  I decided to make the big dive and enroll in [Omaha Code School][OCS]!

Every day I'm learning exponentially more than I thought my brain could cram in! It's an exciting venture (and frustrating at times...), but I'm loving learning to code!
